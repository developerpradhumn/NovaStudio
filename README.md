🪩  Overview

NovaStudio is a modern, multi-section website template designed for creative agencies, startups, design studios, and tech companies that want a high-end, futuristic, and elegant digital presence.

This isn’t a simple landing page — it’s a full, professional website layout with advanced UI/UX patterns, subtle motion design, and a highly responsive structure.

The aesthetic is inspired by award-winning sites on Awwwards, Dribbble, and Behance — minimal yet expressive, sophisticated yet accessible.

💎  Design Philosophy

NovaStudio follows a “less noise, more clarity” approach — combining modern web craftsmanship with timeless visual hierarchy.

Visual Language
	•	Glassmorphism & Soft Depth: semi-transparent panels, blur layers, and layered light to create a futuristic vibe.
	•	Typography: ‘Poppins’ + ‘Space Grotesk’ for a balance of geometry and personality.
	•	Motion UI: micro-interactions that feel responsive and natural (e.g. reveals, counters, parallax).
	•	Color Scheme: adaptable dark/light theme, with neon-accent gradients for visual energy.

UX / UI Principles
	•	Accessibility-focused (semantic HTML & contrast)
	•	Smooth scrolling & reveal-on-scroll animations
	•	Sticky navigation and intuitive mobile menu
	•	Adaptive grid system (Flexbox + CSS Grid)
	•	Minimal use of JavaScript — pure, fast, and SEO-friendly

⸻

⚙️  Technical Features
	•	🧱 Clean HTML5 structure — fully semantic and SEO-ready.
	•	🎨 Modern CSS3 — uses variables, flexbox, grid, transitions, and blur effects.
	•	💡 Interactive JavaScript:

	•	Animated counters
	•	Reveal-on-scroll
	•	Portfolio category filtering

🖥️  How to Use Locally
	1.	Download all files (index.html, styles.css, scripts.js).
	2.	Keep them in the same folder on your computer.
	3.	Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).
	4.	You can edit content directly in index.html using any text editor (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++).
